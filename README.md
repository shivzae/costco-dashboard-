# 🏪 Costco Wholesale Sales Dashboard

This Power BI project provides an **interactive and data-driven dashboard** to analyze Costco Wholesale’s sales performance across regions, segments, and product categories.

* Understand the **impact of customer segments and shipping modes** on revenue

The sales data existed in **multiple disconnected sources**, making it difficult to extract insights quickly or accurately.
